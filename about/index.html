<p>Hello everyone! I'm Jillian Tan- aspiring TPM taking Information Systems at Stony Brook University with a minor in Communication and Innovation. I'm a sophomore, and I love making things happen.</p>

<p>For as long as I have been working with people, I have believed in uplifting everyone and helping everyone make an impact in meaningful ways. In  group endeavors, I have guided others in their own paths in ways that benefit the organization. Please see my experience and past roles for more information on my leadership philosophy.</p>

<p>I enjoy thinking about problems in a logical manner, and I prefer learning new concepts over memorization any day. </p>

<p> I am most interested in finding practical solutions to real problems, most particularly in the backend and leadership sides. I understand how important good leadership impacts team performance, and I am passionate about bringing everyone to their best selves on the team. </p>
